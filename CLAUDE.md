# SmartGov: TUP Manila e-PDS and e-SALN Compliance System

## Project Overview

Thesis project for a secure web-based system enabling **Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) Manila** employeesâ€”including professors, faculty members, and administrative staffâ€”to submit and manage Personal Data Sheets (e-PDS) and Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (e-SALN) in compliance with Civil Service Commission (CSC) standards. Replaces paper workflows with a modern, auditable digital platform tailored for university operations.

### Target Users

- **Faculty Members (Professors/Instructors)**: Submit and update PDS/SALN forms (employee portal)
- **Administrative Staff**: Submit and update PDS/SALN forms (employee portal)
- **Department Heads**: Review department submissions and manage department compliance
- **College Deans**: Oversight of college-level submissions and compliance reporting
- **HR Personnel/University Administrators**: Review all submissions, manage users, generate compliance reports (admin portal)

## Development Principles

This project prioritizes **four core pillars** in all development decisions:

### âš¡ Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Use `React.lazy()` and dynamic imports for heavy components
- **Image Optimization**: Leverage Next.js `<Image>` component with proper sizing and formats
- **Database Queries**: Optimize with proper indexing, avoid N+1 queries, use Drizzle's query builder efficiently
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor with `@next/bundle-analyzer`, keep initial JS load under 200KB
- **Web Vitals Targets**:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1
- **Caching**: Implement SWR/React Query patterns for data fetching
- **Server Components**: Prefer React Server Components over Client Components when possible

### ðŸ§¹ Clean Code Standards

- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, meaningful names (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types)
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid code duplicationâ€”extract reusable logic into utilities/hooks
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component should do one thing well
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply to component architecture and business logic
- **Meaningful Comments**: Document complex logic, edge cases, and "why" (not "what")
- **Consistent Formatting**: Rely on Prettier/ESLintâ€”run `npm run lint` before committing
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict modeâ€”no `any` types without explicit justification

### ðŸ”§ Maintainable Code

- **Modular Design**: Break down large components into smaller, composable pieces
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from UI logic
- **Reusable Utilities**: Place shared utilities in `@smartgov/*` packages
- **Comprehensive Types**: Define interfaces/types in `@smartgov/types` for cross-app consistency
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for utilities, integration tests for API routes, e2e tests for critical flows
- **Documentation**: Document complex patterns, architectural decisions, and integration points
- **Version Control**: Use meaningful commit messages, keep commits atomic

### âœ¨ Better User Experience

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear hierarchy, breadcrumbs, contextual navigation
- **Loading States**: Use skeleton screens and spinners to indicate progress
- **Error Handling**: Provide helpful, actionable error messages with recovery options
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA complianceâ€”keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management
- **Mobile Responsive**: Design mobile-first, test across devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Feedback & Validation**: Instant validation feedback, success confirmations, toast notifications
- **Performance Perception**: Optimistic UI updates, smooth transitions, immediate interactions

## Monorepo Architecture

This is a Turbo-managed monorepo with separate applications and shared packages:

### Apps (apps/\*)

- **employee**: Employee-facing portal (port 3000) for PDS/SALN submissions
- **admin**: HR/Admin portal (port 3001) for reviewing and managing submissions

### Shared Packages (packages/\*)

- **@smartgov/database**: Drizzle ORM schemas, migrations, and database utilities
- **@smartgov/auth**: Authentication utilities and middleware
- **@smartgov/types**: Shared TypeScript type definitions
- **@smartgov/shared-ui**: Shared UI components

Both apps are Next.js 15.5.3 applications using App Router with Turbopack. They consume shared packages via workspace dependencies.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3, React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack (via `--turbopack` flag) for fast development
- **Monorepo**: Turbo for task orchestration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Magic UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Drizzle ORM
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Custom auth package with MFA (input-otp)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (motion package)

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start all apps
npm run dev

# Start specific app
npm run dev:employee    # Starts employee portal on port 3000
npm run dev:admin       # Starts admin portal on port 3001

# Build all apps
npm run build

# Build specific app
npm run build:employee
npm run build:admin
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint          # Lint all packages/apps
npm run type-check    # TypeScript type checking across monorepo
npm run clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

### Database Operations

Navigate to `packages/database` or use these commands:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate    # Generate migrations from schema
npx drizzle-kit migrate     # Run pending migrations
npx drizzle-kit studio      # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
```

## Development Guidelines

### Working with the Monorepo

- **Apps are independent**: Each app has its own Next.js config, middleware, and routes
- **Shared packages are internal**: Import from `@smartgov/*` namespaces
- **Turbo orchestrates tasks**: Build/lint/type-check tasks run in dependency order
- **Package changes rebuild dependent apps**: Turbo handles cache invalidation

### Code Organization

**Apps Structure (apps/employee or apps/admin):**

```
apps/[employee|admin]/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/              # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # App-specific components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/              # App-specific utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware.ts         # Next.js middleware for auth/routing
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.ts        # Next.js configuration
â””â”€â”€ components.json       # shadcn/ui configuration
```

**Database Package (packages/database):**

```
packages/database/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schema/           # Drizzle table schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/       # SQL migration files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts          # Exports schemas and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ drizzle.config.ts     # Drizzle Kit configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Shared database layer**: All database schemas and queries centralized in `@smartgov/database`
2. **Type safety**: TypeScript strict mode with Drizzle-generated types
3. **Authentication middleware**: Applied at the Next.js middleware level in each app
4. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented at the Supabase database level for data isolation
5. **Form validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation, shared via `@smartgov/types`
6. **Performance architecture**:
   - Prefer Server Components for data fetching
   - Use React Query/SWR for client-side caching
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Strategic use of ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for semi-static pages

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements hierarchical access control aligned with TUP Manila's organizational structure:

### Access Levels

| Role                | Access Scope                | Capabilities                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faculty/Staff**   | Own records only            | View/edit personal PDS/SALN, submit for review                       |
| **Department Head** | Department records          | View all department submissions, approve/return for revision         |
| **College Dean**    | College-level records       | View all college submissions across departments, oversight reporting |
| **HR Personnel**    | All records                 | Full access to all submissions, user management, compliance reports  |
| **System Admin**    | All records + system config | Full system access, user role management, system configuration       |

### Implementation Notes

- **RLS Policies**: Enforce at database level using Supabase RLS based on user role and organizational hierarchy
- **Middleware**: Next.js middleware validates role before rendering protected routes
- **Audit Logging**: All cross-user access logged with timestamp, role, and action
- **Future Integration**: Placeholder for university SSO/LDAP integration to sync roles with institutional directory

### University Organizational Hierarchy

```
TUP Manila
â””â”€â”€ Colleges
    â””â”€â”€ Departments
        â””â”€â”€ Faculty/Staff Members
```

Database schema supports multi-level hierarchy for accurate role-based filtering and reporting.

## Branding & Theme System

The application uses a modern, premium, and minimalistic design system aligned with TUP Manila's institutional identity.

### Design Philosophy

- **Modern**: Clean layouts, ample whitespace, contemporary UI patterns
- **Premium**: Subtle shadows, smooth animations, polished interactions
- **Minimalistic**: Focus on content, reduce visual noise, intentional design choices

### Color System

**TUP Manila Official Colors** (to be obtained from university):

```css
/* Placeholder - Update with official TUP Manila brand colors */
:root {
  /* Primary Colors */
  --color-tup-primary: #0066cc; /* TUP Blue - Primary brand color */
  --color-tup-secondary: #ffd700; /* TUP Gold - Accent color */

  /* Neutral Palette */
  --color-background: #ffffff;
  --color-foreground: #0a0a0a;
  --color-muted: #f5f5f5;
  --color-muted-foreground: #6b7280;
  --color-border: #e5e7eb;

  /* Semantic Colors */
  --color-success: #10b981;
  --color-warning: #f59e0b;
  --color-error: #ef4444;
  --color-info: #3b82f6;
}
```

**Note**: Contact TUP Manila's Communications/Marketing office to obtain official brand guidelines including:

- Pantone/hex codes for university colors
- Logo usage specifications
- Typography guidelines
- Official imagery and iconography

### Tailwind CSS 4 Configuration

Extend Tailwind configuration in each app's `tailwind.config.ts`:

```typescript
// Example customization for TUP Manila theme
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        tup: {
          primary: 'var(--color-tup-primary)',
          secondary: 'var(--color-tup-secondary)',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        heading: ['Lexend', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Component Styling Guidelines

**shadcn/ui Customization:**

- Configure theme colors in `components.json` to use TUP Manila palette
- Maintain consistent border radius (`rounded-lg` for cards, `rounded-md` for buttons)
- Use consistent spacing scale (Tailwind's default 4px scale)

**Magic UI Integration:**
Premium effects for enhanced UX:

- **Animated Backgrounds**: `dot-pattern`, `retro-grid`, `animated-grid-pattern` for hero sections
- **Interactive Buttons**: `shimmer-button`, `rainbow-button` for primary CTAs
- **Text Animations**: `animated-gradient-text`, `text-reveal` for headlines
- **Special Effects**: `shine-border`, `border-beam` for highlighted cards/sections
- **Smooth Transitions**: Use Framer Motion for page transitions, modal animations

**Dark Mode Support:**

- Implement system-preferred dark mode using Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS 4
- Ensure all colors have dark mode variants
- Test readability and contrast ratios in both modes

### Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Focus States**: Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, alt text for images
- **Responsive Text**: Font sizes scale appropriately, minimum 16px for body text

### Typography Scale

```css
/* Recommended typography hierarchy */
h1: text-4xl font-heading font-bold (36px)
h2: text-3xl font-heading font-semibold (30px)
h3: text-2xl font-heading font-semibold (24px)
h4: text-xl font-heading font-medium (20px)
body: text-base font-sans (16px)
small: text-sm font-sans (14px)
```

## Security Considerations
